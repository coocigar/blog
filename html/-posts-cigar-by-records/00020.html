<h3>Cigar Review: Oliva Serie G Robusto</h3>

<p>
    It another lovely looking cigar. It does look very much like a chocolate bar
    when everything is out of the
    cellophane. The size of this cigar is 4.5 x 50 which I think it's a cute
    size for a short relaxing smoke. &#127851;

    I really like the appearance of the cigar. As much as it looks like a
    chocolate bar, I did not taste much of
    chocolate/coca or any sweetness. Maybe it has a very subtle hint of dark
    chocolate and black coffee, but that was
    not the primary flavour that I received.

    The flavour is mostly filled with a floral type of nuttiness. It is a
    different type of nuttiness from Montecristo
    White Series or Flor de las Antillas. Oliva G taste more like almond type of
    nut to me whereas the other ones remind
    me more of cashew. I quite enjoy it despite the fact that I don't usually
    like eating nuts. &#127792;

    The draw is perfect for me. I was taking small puffs and good breaks trying
    not to overheat the cigar. I purged the
    cigar from time to time too. I'd say that it went pretty well. I was able to
    taste more. The ash, however, has some
    strange white dots on it throughout the smoke. I'm not sure what is going on
    there. &#128517;

    The cigar was smooth and did not have any harsh sharp taste. The smoke time
    for me was about 45min. I took my time.
    I was able to reach pretty much the end of this cigar. I think this is the
    first for me to reach this far on a
    premium cigar. The flavour was not as prominent at this point and I ended as
    soon as I tasted that familiar sharp
    bitter taste.

    I was absolutely amazed by how good this little cigar was. The flavour was
    good. It did not produce a huge amount of
    smoke that made it a perfect cigar to have at home (with proper ventilation)
    in my opinion. It was a fantastic smoke
    and I enjoy my time with it thoroughly. &#10084;
