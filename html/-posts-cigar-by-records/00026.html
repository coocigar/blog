<h3>Cigar Review: Trinidad Reyes</h3>

<p>
    This is a pretty small cigar. I thought it would be giving me a shorter time
    of smoke like 15-20 min because of the size, but it lasted about 40 minutes
    for me.

<p>
    The size of this cigar is at a length of 11 cm with a ring gauge of 40. It's
    a pretty compact form. The draw is a bit on the firm side, but acceptable to
    me. The pigtail is just really cute &#10084;

    I had this one sitting in my humidor (cigar storage box) for a few weeks
    before I cut it. I was surprised by how the pieces stayed together for a
    good humid cigar. I believe all the ones that I had before were too dry so
    the cap just instantly shattered everywhere. This cut, however, was
    extremely clean. &#129529; &#10024;

<p>
    The first few draws were smooth and nutty at the start. Fairly enjoyable. I
    was also managed to light everything up evenly this time. I think it is just
    overall easier to toast a smaller cigar. It did not take me too long or gave
    me a hard time.

    The ash was more on the darker side. However, it did not give me any weird
    or unpleasant taste as <a href="./00019.html"><strong>Hoyo de Monterrey -
            Rio Seco</strong></a>. The burn was not too bad. It was not windy,
    but I was walking. The burn line didn't grow too crooked or too badly that
    needed to be constantly on watch.

<p>
    Towards the end of the cigar, it gave me a woody, leathery, spice. I ended
    it earlier because I don't particularly enjoy that spice and I actually had
    an appointment to run to. It was a chill night and a relaxing smoke though.
    I enjoy my time thoroughly with it. &#128101;

<p>
    Even though it was a chill night and I ended the cigar earlier, I still
    missed my appointment. &#128517; I was walking around a neighbourhood that I
    thought I was familiar with, but apparently it wasn't true and that I got
    lost. I kept going back in a mysterious loop at least twice until I gave up
    and ask Google map for help. It took me more than double the time to get
    home, but I made it back safely. &#129396;
