<h3>Cigar Review: Romeo Y Julieta No. 2</h3>


<p>I should have picked up Wide Churchill instead. I did not enjoy this one.</p>

<p>
    The reason that I picked up this one over Wide Churchill was because it came in a tube. I thought it can at least
    last for a few more days, but I didn't think I could smoke again so soon. I would have got Wide Churchill if I knew
    I could smoke on the same day that I purchased it.

<p>
    I'm not sure if it is because the cigar was resting in the tube that Romeo Y Julieta No. 2 just felt way more moist
    than H. Upmann Half Corona. Half Corona was mellow, but crispy. It was probably too dry though. However, No. 2 just
    feels mellow and soggy. I'm guessing this one is too humid. It's slightly more firm and feels like it has less
    airflow.

<p>
    The start of the Romeo Y Julieta No. 2 was pretty good. It has a similar sweet aroma as H. Upmann Half Corona.
    Creamy and sweet! No. 2 is more prominent with the coffee taste which is nice. But, that was pretty much the only
    part that I enjoyed.

<p>
    Midway to the cigar, I had the same issue with H. Upmann Half Corona where the cigar looked like it wasn't burning.
    I brushed off the ash and relight it. The good sweet flavour was back! For a very short sip though, then it was lost
    completely.

<p>
    It transitioned into something like cedar, woody type of scent and it was a bit more sharp. It ended on a leather
    note which I truly did not favour. Since I did not enjoy this one as much, I ended this cigar a bit earlier than H.
    Upmann Half Corona.

<p>
    My fingers, my breath were all ended with this woody-leather note which I really dislike. The smell has stuck with
    me for a couple days after this smoke. I'm not a fan of this one for the flavours. Having that said, I can at least
    keep the aluminum tube and use it as a carrying case for the time being.

<p>
    Since my chance for smoking a cigar is super-duper rare, I will not risk it again unless I've tried everything that
    was top recommended. I think I like sweet cigars more. This is probably a cigar that's loved by many, but sadly it's
    just not my favourite profile and I'm quite disappointed.
