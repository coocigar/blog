<h3>Cigar Review: Ramon Allones Specially Selected</h3>

<p>
    In this post, I will share with you my review of <strong>Ramon Allones
        Specially Selected</strong>. Maybe my palette is not fully developed
    yet, but I tried my best to take down my notes. Let's check it out!

    This is a smooth cigar. I did not taste spice at all like any other cigars.
    It's been sitting in my cigar storage box for a few weeks though so maybe
    that affected it a little bit. It was smooth for me.

    The burn was pretty good. It was pretty straight throughout and I didn't
    have to touch it up too many times when I was having this one outdoor. The
    ash was white and I think it looks pretty nice as well.

    The cigar started out as almond type of nuttiness for me. Definitely woody
    scent. Midway through, I did not taste much else other than tobacco though.
    It turned slightly sour in the middle, but that did not last very long. I
    mostly just tasted tobacco towards the end of my smoke.

    I ended the cigar after noticing that it was out. I was trying to light it
    up again, but decided not to because it was getting dark and I wasn't
    tasting any other interesting flavours other than maybe smoke. I definitely
    overheat the cigar that it dug into the middle. Kinda cool!

    My smoke time for this one was a little bit over than 50 minutes. I had this
    one in a quiet neighbourhood near the train that's close to a park. It
    started out as a calm no-wind day. The wind started to pick up after the sun
    went down towards the end of my cigar though.

<p>
    Overall, I enjoy my time with this cigar. The flavour is not the most
    interesting from what I experienced, but it's a good cigar.
