<h3>
    Cigar Log: Cohiba Siglo I (2)
</h3>


<p>
    Happy Friday! Hope everyone's day has been going well so far. Today we will
    be looking at a beautiful small Cohiba cigar. This is my second Siglo I and
    I had a better experience with this one.
</p>

    The first few puffs was so creamy. It was like sweet tobacco. It was much
    smoother than what I had previously. It's strange that when I first light it
    up, the whole feet just turn black. It was only at the start and back to
    normal very soon.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    Coming to the middle third, it was very similar tobacco taste. There's not
    much sweetness around and the flavours feel much more fainted. I didn't
    taste any spice at all at this point unlike last time, which is definitely
    nice. &#128077;

    The draw was a bit too tight but still flows. I had to be careful to not
    draw too hard or too light. The burn was a bit crooked. I had to fix it one
    time but just that once. It self corrected itself most of the time.
</p>

<p>
    The ash is not as black as last time. I think I draw too hard too fast last
    time that I tasted pretty much just bitter spicy ash. This time, I slowed
    down a lot and purged often. I was actually able to taste more. The ash
    couldn't seem to build up very long. It was kinda fragile.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    Coming to the final third, I smoked it down almost all the way to the nub.
    It's a little overheat and the flavours are pretty much all gone at this
    point. I had a bit of salty tobacco and that's all I could describe. Good
    session and I thoroughly enjoy it.

<p>
    The smoke time for this one was about 50 minutes. I really took my time by
    reading a book with this cigar. I think this is a better size for me to sit
    down and enjoy everything it can offer. I would definitely pick up more of
    these in the future.

    Anyways, that's all I have for today. As I mentioned earlier, this is the
    second
    Cohiba Siglo I that I had and you can check out my first impression of <a
