<h3>Cigar Review: Hoyo de Monterrey - Le Hoyo de Rio Seco</h3>

<p>
    This is a cigar that I unfortunately did not enjoy. It's probably not an issue with the cigar, but more of my
    beginner user mistakes. &#128546;

    I will start by saying the draw was good for me. Not too tight and not too loose. I was also able to get a little
    bit of flavours at the start. I tasted some nuttiness. A little bit of woody notes and cedar. No sweetness at all
    come to mind. But other than a few initial puffs, the rest was bitter sharp spices. Pretty much taste like burned
    wood all the way. It is just very different from what other reviewers described this cigar.

    This is a premium cigar at a price of about CDN$50. However, as you can see from the ash, it's pretty much just
    black tar throughout. I was actually walking around a busy neighbourhood on that day. It could be that I was too
    conscious about my surrounding that I just didn't toast the cigar enough. Maybe that is why it tasted like burnt
    wood to me. I was probably just tasting all that tar.

    I really should've picked a better place to take the walk and enjoy this cigar. I drove around to pick a quiet
    neighbourhood. After I got off the car and started walking around, I realized it was not quiet at all. I was in
    between an elementary and a high school.
</p>
<p>
    The cigar band is beautiful. It might actually also be because this cigar was too young and needed aging on this
    though. I did try my best to enjoy it since it was pricy, but I just couldn't because of the bad taste. I will
    probably have to go back and pick up another one to give a more proper judgement.

    As usual, I ended this cigar quite a bit early since I couldn't taste anything good. The smoke time for this one was
    about 45-50min while being outdoor with relatively low wind. I did not enjoy it as much though because there were
    just too many kids running around. I just wanted some alone time with the smoke there.

    Anyways, that's my bad experience with this one. If you think I deserve a better cigar, please consider supporting
    this website so I can share more posts with you. Thank you and enjoy your day now! &#10084;
