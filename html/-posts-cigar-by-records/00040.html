<h3>Cigar Log: Davidoff Winston Churchill Belicoso (4)</h3>

<p>
    Hope everyone's holiday has been going well! I did not think that I would
    have a chance to enjoy a cigar before 2023 ends since it's been so cold, but
    here we are.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    Today I'm enjoy my last stick of Davidoff Winston Churchill Belicoso. It's
    been a few months since I last picked up a cigar. I went with straight cut
    at an angle for this one. I think I might have chopped too much off. &#128517;
</p>

<p class="center">
    <img src="../../img/-posts-cigar-by-records/00040/02.jpeg" />
</p>

<p>
    It started out with a very reminiscing scent. It's that creamy Davidoff
    taste as every other ones that I had previously. Ah~ I almost forgot how
    nice it feels to have a cigar in hand. 	&#x1F970;
</p>

    <img style="width: 55%" src="../../img/-posts-cigar-by-records/00040/04.jpeg" />
</p>

<p>
    However, very similar to every other Davidoff belicoso, that lovely taste is
    pretty much gone right after like 5 puffs. By the time it even reaches 1/5th
    of the cigar, the flavour was pretty much gone.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    It could be due to a few factors though. One, I could've been overheating
    the cigar. I definitely wasn't being patient with this one because I just
    missed cigar so much. But, two, the cigar might have been too moist.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    The wrapper leaf looks a bit thick while it was burning. I'm using Boveda
    69% for my humidor (or just cigar storage). I didn't leave it out to dry so
    that could have been the reason. Anyhow, it still had a little bit of that
    Davidoff taste, but mostly just sour after reaching about end of first
    third.
</p>

<p class="center">
    <img src="../../img/-posts-cigar-by-records/00040/07.jpeg" />
</p>

<p>
    Moving on to the second third, well, I definitely overheated it because it
    just turned a bit sour and bitter for me. I did chop the head of the cigar
    further to remove the black ash and was able to enjoy it further. It was a
    good relaxing thinking session.
</p>

<p class="center">
    <img src="../../img/-posts-cigar-by-records/00040/08.jpeg" />
</p>

<p>
    Now I ended the cigar early at the end of second third. It was producing a
    ton of smoke output and I do find looking at the smoke relaxing. Having that
    said, the flavours that I like were gone and I don't like the bitter end.
    Hence it's ended early.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    Smoke time was about 20 minutes for me. Again, I ended this one early so it
    could have probably lasted a bit longer. But anyways, it was a good session.
    This will be the last post for this year. I will see you all in 2024! Thanks
    for reading and enjoy your day &#10084;
