<h3>Cigar Review: Oliva G Robusto (2)</h3>

<p>
    Since I was having such a wonderful time with <strong>Oliva G</strong> last
    time. I thought
    it's a chill and light cigar so I picked up two more. However, this <storng>
        Oliva G</storng>
    that I had for today was slightly different.
</p>

</p>


<p>
    The cigar started out good as last time. The flavour that I got was smooth
    almond type of nuttiness. It was woody, but not sweetness or coffee taste.
    Midway through, I tasted toasted nuttiness with a bit of spice and a strange
    sour taste. That sour taste did not exist in all puffs though.

<p>
    I did notice that the smoke output for this one has a bigger amount than my
    previous Oliva G. The burn kept growing crooked for some reason and the
    experience was just not as relaxing as my first Oliva G. I have to
    constantly fix it, but it would grow crooked again. The ash looks
    beautifully white and did not have as many little white ball as last time.

    The smoke time for this one was a little bit over an hour. It was about
    15-20 min longer than my first <strong>Oliva G</strong>. It's a fairly long
    smoke consider this is not a big cigar. I actually got nicotine sickness
    from this one. This cigar was more smoky than the previous one and I did not
    properly vent the smoke out. The whole room was covered in smoke.

    I had to end it earlier than I originally planned to because I started to
    feel dizzy, got a bad headache, and felt a bit nauseous. I could barely
    stand. My first thought was to put out the smoke and air out the room.
</p>
<p>
    Then I realized that I might actually be dehydrated. I swallowed down two
    glasses of water then sat down to wait for the dizziness to go away. After
    feeling slightly better, I took a shower to be in a more humid environment
    and wash all the smoke away. Thank goodness that the headache was gone
    within an hour and I was able to do proper clean up afterwards.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The lesson here for me:</strong> it does matter how small the cigar
    is, smoking
    indoor even with the vent on is never a good idea. Avoid at all cost!!

    I hope you won't make the same mistake as I did. Enjoy your cigar in the
    beautiful nature. Stay safe and have a wonderful day! &#128170; &#127958;
