<h3>Cigar Review: My Father - Flor De Las Antillas Robusto</h3>

<p>
    This is my first taste of New World cigar! It's an ok cigar in my opinion. I'm still pretty new to the cigar world,
    but I think I prefer Cubans for now.

<p>
    This is not the first time that I've seen cigar in plastic wrapper. I think that might just be a U.S. thing, but I
    don't particular mind it.

    The cigar itself is beautiful. I love the dark brown colour of the wrapper. It's also presented with this
    rectangle-looking press, so it doesn't roll of the table if I place it down. I think this is a pretty good idea! &#128518;
    I am not a huge fan of the band though. I think it looks a bit dull and plain. &#128566;

    Anyways, before I go on and talk about the flavours, I am proud to say that I was able to cut off just the cap with
    my guillotine cutter for the first time! Proud of my cut!!

<p>
    When I was doing a cold draw, I tasted strong nutty and almost cinnamon flavour. When I light it up and take the
    first few draws, I tasted spice. It was a smooth spice. It's not that type of hot spice that will choke you or burn
    you. It's weird but smooth spice is really the best term that I could come up with what I experienced. &#127788;

<p>
    Towards the mid-end sections, I couldn't really taste much other than maybe slight hint of floral woody type of
    sweetness. Most of it just tobacco burn for me. I couldn't quite finish the cigar till the end because the smoke
    kept going into my eyes and nose whenever I'm trying to take a draw. I ended the cigar quite early as I wasn't
    tasting any other interesting flavours.

    It was a fine cigar. It's not bad, but I wouldn't actively go back for another one. I only picked this one up
    because this is the only brand that I recognized from the cigar shop that I went. They only have New World cigars
    and I thought to give it a try.
</p>
<p>
    The smoke time for me was about 50 minutes. I was walking around the neighbourhood in quite a calm evening
    (midnight-ish). Not much wind and the BiC lighter can surprisingly keep my cigar lit. The cigar is not the best, but
    the session was good. &#127747;

    <strong>Bonus short story</strong><br>
    Midway during my walk, the cigar went out. I flicked my BiC &#128541; and instantly I felt like someone's watching. Because
    it's the middle of the night, BiC flame was super bright. However, since it was not a threatening type of eyes that
    I felt, I decided to ignore it. Lit the cigar, took a few puffs, then all the sudden! I saw a police car pass me up
    at a good speed. I guess the feeling of being watched was a cop making sure that I wasn't playing with fire or
    burning anything. It was an uneasy feeling, but all ended good. &#128517;
