<h3>Cigar Log: Oliva Serie G (5)</h3>

<p>
    I can't believe this is the fifth Oliva G here. This one is slightly
    different
    than what I previously had. That's take a look.
</p>

</p>


<p>
    I noticed for this particular stick along with the other two Oliva G's that
    I bought a few weeks ago, feels really moist when I took them out of the
    cellophane. They had this really sharp young cigar smell from the wrapper.
    Quite sus and definitely not good. &#128373;
</p>

</p>

<p>
    Here I can quickly show you the wet-dry line too. I'm not sure what caused
    it, but it definitely doesn't look right.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    Contrary to the Oliva G's that I had in the past, this wrapper was just too
    loose that it couldn't hold the burn well. The burn line was crooked and
    ugly that I had to constantly fix it all the time. It wouldn't correct
    itself like it used to. Wait, this kinda reminds me about Rocky Patel
    Vintage 1992. It's exactly a similar burn issue.
</p>

<p class="center">

        <img src="../../img/-posts-cigar-by-records/00045/09.jpeg" alt="09">
    </span>
</p>

<p>
    Other than the burn issue, this particular stick just generate so much smoke
    that I think it breathe out more smoke on the head than from the tail. It
    was kinda frustrating. All these two issue just keep happening continuously
    all the way till the end.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    And because the wrapper is so detached, you can see that the line where it
    sort of expanded to. Now I should note that when I first picked this one up,
    it was a bit too wet so I dried it out and let it sat in a 65% RH
    environment. Maybe it is too dry and I needed to stay 69%. Either way, this
    particular did not work out well for me.
</p>

<p>
    What worked though, was that I tried out this CIGARLOONG ashtray that I
    bought the other day. It was a bit tight, but it indeed hold the ash
    somewhat well. It is also easy to dump the ash and clean after. But with
    that being said, this is the first Oliva G that I couldn't continue past the
    band.

</p>

<p>
    Even though I didn't finish it completely, this session still lasted for
    around 40 minutes because I had to constantly put it down to prevent
    overheating. I will have to examine the condition more carefully in the
    future before I take them to the counter.

    Anyways, if you think I deserve a better cigar, please consider supporting
    this website for more cigar reviews like this. If not, hey, I still
    appreciate you very much for hanging around! Thanks for reading and I'll see
    you in my next post!  &#129294;
