<h3>My First Ever Smoke: King Palm Mango OG</h3>

<p>
    This is kind of a funny story. I have never smoked a cigarette before. I
    have never smoked marijuana. My first
    ever-and-only smoke before my first cigar (H. Upmann Half Corona) was an
    empty tube of Mango OG &#128514;
</p>

    I was shopping with my boyfriend when we first saw this at a smoke shop.
    King Palm was placed somewhat far away so
    from the shelf, so my boyfriend thought it as a mango flavoured cigar. He
    told me about this mango flavoured cigar
    after we left the store, so I asked him to pick this up when he pass by the
    store the next time. And he did.

    When he took it home a few days after, I was like, it doesn't feel like a
    cigar. It's way too thin. When I opened it
    up, it was two empty tubes and no fillings. The next step of course, was to
    search it up on Google. First thing that
    I found was he paid overprice for this thing. The second thing was that the
    fillings were actually for weed and this
    is just the wrapper... &#129318;

    Neither of us smoke nor know anything about weed. I personally don't find
    the smell of weed fascinating. My
    boyfriend suggested burning and smoke just the wrapper &#128514;. The
    package, after all, said it does not contain any
    tobacco or other addictives. So he light it up, followed the instructions
    and gave it a few press on the filter. And
    we smoked an empty tube.

    We did not tasted anything mango. All my boyfriend tasted was burning paper.
    I smelled some light sweetness to it
    (probably just the leaves), but there was nothing mango about it. We were
    able to get a few puffs (like maybe 5 or 6
    puffs each) before it went out though. It was a short smoke. Fun but no
    mango. &#129300;

    The following day, I smoked the second wrapper by myself because he didn't
    enjoy it. Towards the end of my smoke, I
    thought hey, I should give it try and squeeze the end myself. Then I heard a
    "POP!?????" &#128563; There was the mango
    smell everywhere... But, I've reached the end of the smoke...

    The mango smelled really sweet and it was nice, but we didn't get it right
    at all lol. &#128517; What a waste... Then again,
    it wouldn't be correct anyways because I'm not interested in weed or the
    fillings. And there goes my first
    experience of remotely close to smoking anything. Not a cigarette, not weed,
    not vape, not cigar; It's an empty tube
    of King Palm with zero flavours...

    By the way, we went back to that store again a few weeks after and they
    actually do not carry cigars... &#129315;
