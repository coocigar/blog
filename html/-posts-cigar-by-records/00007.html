<h3>Cigar Log: Phillies - Blunt Strawberry 1 (Top Half, with Wrapper)</h3>

<p style="font-size: smaller">
    Previously:<br>
    &#8226; I Bought More Phillies Cigars... and my not-so-great plan<br>
    &#8226; Cigar Log: Phillies - Blunt Strawberry 1 (Bottom Half, no Wrapper)
</p>
<p>

    As I mentioned previously, I cut one of the cheap cigar in half and reviewed the bottom half already. In this post,
    I will share my experience with the top half, which is in the proper cigar form, but shorter.

<p>
    <strong>Flavour</strong><br>
    In turns of the flavour, it is similar to my first Phillies Strawberry. It has no complexity and has nothing
    interesting more to note other than the sweetness is more prominent. I still couldn't taste the strawberry flavour,
    but at least it did not leave the sharp spicy taste on my tongue as the other half. This was store in my bag for at
    least 3 days more than the bottom half and I'm not sure if that affected and smoothed out anything.

<p>
    <strong>Smoke Time and Setting</strong><br>
    This half was smoked on a super windy day before the storm. I was walking around the neighbourhood and was having
    trouble keeping the fire on my BiC lighter up to toast the cigar. The smoke time was about 15min as well under
    strong wind condition. Pretty short session, but I enjoyed it.

<p>
    <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
    I still couldn't taste any strawberry. I feel like my sense of smell might have been plugged. Because of the smoke,
    the &#127827; flavour was being masked. I do like the short smoke session though. I'll give another try next time.
