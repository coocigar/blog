<h3>Cigar Log: Phillies - Blunt Strawberry 1 (Bottom Half, no Wrapper)</h3>

<p>
    As mention from my previous post: I Bought More Phillies Cigars... and my not-so-great plan, I cut one of my Phillies
    Blunt Strawberry in half for experiment. In this post, I will share my thoughts and experience of the bottom half of
    the cigar without the wrapper leaf.

<p>
    <strong>Flavour</strong><br>
    I didn't taste as much sweetness to it. It has a very subtle hint of sweetness, but it's very close to none. Of
    course, I still taste no strawberry. It's a light body cigar, which I don't mind but it lacks of complexity. It also
    left quite a bit of sharp spice on my tongue, which I am not a fan of. I am not sure if it's directly related to the
    missing wrapper, or if the cigar is just too young, either way I did not enjoy this half as much.

<p>
    <strong>Smoke Time and Setting</strong><br>
    The smoke time was about 10-15min on a rather calm night. The burn is not the prettiest. One funny thing to note was
    that I didn't realized that I was smoking in a high-voltage area where my hand felt a slight tingly numb. I didn't
    know the detail, but I left pretty much immediately as I saw the sign. &#9889;

<p>
    <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
    Overall, I think it's a good length to smoke. I am always kinda conscious and nervous about smoking in public. This
    is a quick smoke which I like. However, I did not enjoy the sharp taste on my tongue and I did not taste much in
    turns of the flavour. Maybe the other half of this cigar would be better. We'll see. &#128521;

    And that's all I have for you. If you enjoy this post, please do consider supporting this website. Thank you and
    have a wonderful day! &#127827;
