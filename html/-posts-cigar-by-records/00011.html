<h3>Cigar Log: Phillies - Blunt Strawberry 2</h3>

<p>
    Similar to the first one, I cut the cigar in half. What's different than the first one was that this one has water
    damage because I was trying to get a picture of a wet cigar. Yea, that sounds stupid, but anyways, here's my
    experience.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    Just for the records, I dried this off completely and let it sit for 2 days after it was in contact with water. The
    wrapper is soggy from the water damage.
</p>
<p>

    <strong>Preparation</strong><br>
    When I cut the cigar in half last time, the bottom half of the wrapper leaf came off. This time, I tried to keep the
    leaf on by wrapping it with a sticky note. However, after I cut it, I soon found out that this one actually stay in
    place. &#129300; It doesn't need the sticky note at all! The wrapper leaf could be more sticky after the contact with
    water, but I'm not fully sure if that is the cause.

    <strong>Top Half</strong><br>
    First half I was downstairs at my apartment. It was the first time that I was smoking outdoor during daylight. I
    went down at about 7am in the morning on a Saturday. It was quite windy, but I managed to get the cigar lit.

</p>
<p>
    I was watching some tutorial again on how to smoking and I realized that I probably draw too hard for most of my
    smoke in the past. So this time, I just took gentle light puffs and I was surprising able to taste more! Just very
    sweet! And also, to my surprise, it has quite a lot of smoke output even I was taking min-draws! &#127788;

</p>
<p>
    I did taste the sharpness as I had previously experienced with no wrapper though, which I rather unpleasant. Just as
    I thought I was going to finally get the strawberry taste, the cigar went out! &#128550; It lasted only about 5-10min
    probably because of the strong wind. &#128550;&#128550;&#128550;

        I'm sorry that I didn't have a pic of this one on fire. It was nice but I forgot to bring my phone with me... I
        would've got some pretty decent shots. &#128557;

    <strong>Bottom Half</strong><br>
    I was going to grab my phone and go down again to finish this footer half, but it was getting busy. Since it was a
    short smoke, I figured I just quickly finish it so I can try and get the strawberry flavour at ease. I was going to
    smoke on the balcony, but my neighbour was awake. Thus, I turned on the hood fan and just smoked in the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, I didn't get much from this. All I could taste was just smoke and I made my place full of smoke
    again, which I truly regret. I swear I'll never smoke inside my place again no matter how short the smoke it. It
    just wasn't worth it and the time to get the smoke out was annoying. I tasted even less flavours from it than when I
    was downstairs. &#128550;

<p>
    <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
    At least that I know that I should take small gentle puffs next time when I'm outside. I think I'm more comfortable
    with the half size now and I do get very little hint of strawberry in the after taste. I'm not sure if the water
    washed off any taste. Having that said, it might take me a while to get to third one because I did not like the
    sharp taste and didn't feel too well after this one. We'll see though. &#129296;
