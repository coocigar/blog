<h3>Cigar Review: Hoyo de Monterrey - Epicure No. 2</h3>

<p>
    This is the cigar that was recommended to me by many people. Whenever I
    brought up the statement that I like <strong>H. Upmann</strong> cigars, the
    salespeople always recommend <strong>Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure No.
        2</strong>. It is also quite loved by many YouTubers, but is it really
    that good? Let's find out!
</p>

    The construction of the cigar looks pretty good. It is well packed and feels
    good in hands. I also have this one sitting in my humidor/storage box for
    quite some time before I enjoy this. It did not cause too much mess from the
    cut, but it's not as clean as Trinidad Reyes.

    The flavour started out pretty smooth. It was sweet, has a hint of cocoa and
    was definitely fruity. Lighting it up was a great pleasure. It's always
    difficult to capture the good cherry with my cheap phone camera in low
    lighting, but I've tried.

    It did not have a great deal of smoke output at the start, but it did got
    more as I progress. Midway through the cigar, the taste started to go south.
    It had a weird sour nutty taste to it. I can't quite describe it, but it
    started after the long ash fell off. It could be that I am overheating the
    cigar again. &#128550;

    The draw was good and the burn was pretty straight. I did not have much
    issue and it didn't grow too crooked. I was having this one on a walk, but
    not an extremely windy day. The burn line stayed consistent throughout and I
    don't have much complain.

    Unfortunately though, the sour taste stay pretty much till the end for me.
    It also turn into extremely bitter taste that was just so unpleasant. It
    does remind me of what I tasted before of <strong>Rio Seco</strong>. Maybe
    it is a signature taste that <strong>Hoyo de Monterrey</strong> features. I
    did not enjoy it as much.

<p>
    Coming to the end of the cigar, I ended it earlier as usual as it didn't
    give me the flavour that I like and I was pretty much near the end anyways.
    The smoke time for this one was surprisingly about 45 min for me. I thought
    it would last me longer. &#128517;

    Anyways, I personally still like the flavours that <strong>H.
        Upmann</strong> offers more. <strong>Epicure No.2</strong> is not bad,
    but I did not enjoy the flavour as much. I did enjoy my walk around the
    neighbourhood though. It was a lovely evening at a fancy townhouse area.
    That's all I have for you today. Thanks for reading and I'll see you next
    time!
