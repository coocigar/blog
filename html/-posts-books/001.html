<h3>Book Review: The Cigar Companion</h3>


<p>
    The book that we're looking at today is
    <strong>The Cigar Companion: The Connoisseur's Guide</strong> by
    <strong>Anwer Bati</strong>. The one that I have here is the 3rd edition.

    This is a pretty small, but premium book. It is a hard-cover book with
    glossy paper print. The book is about 222 pages and it's a very light read.
    The book consists of three main sections.

<p>
    <strong>Section 1: The Story of Cigars</strong><br>
    It started with a brief history of cuban cigars. Then it talked about how a
    cigar is rolled, the difference between machine-made and hand-made cigars,
    and construction of a cigar. The section also included a brief introduction
    of various beginner "how to's" throughout. I found this beginning section
    very educational and entertaining to read.

<p>
    <strong>Section 2: The Cigar Directory</strong><br>
    This section is basically a list of cigars. The author included a lot of
    pictures here! It is sorted alphabetically by the brand name. In each
    subsection, it starts with a brief background about the brand, a list of
    cigar names under the brand, a pic of band, and the author's rating/quick
    info block. I think the cigar pictures in this section is 1:1 ratio, but the
    book is too small that some longer cigar got cutoff from the page.

<p>
    <strong>Section 3: The Buying and Storing of Cigars</strong><br>
    This section could have maybe joined with the first section. It only has
    about 10 pages worth of content and I personally think it would've been
    better if they have a section of beginner "how to's" and include this part
    there. The first section talked about how to select a cigar and also
    mentioned cigar box. This section also ended the book quite abruptly.
    There's no departing words or any sort. It just ended &#128533;

    Overall, I like how this book included lots and <strong>LOTS</strong> of
    pictures. It's a pretty easy read and I enjoy reading this book overall. It
    would be a 10 out of 10 book if it was organized better with the content.
    Nonetheless, I did like the cigar directory part and enjoy looking at
    different pics of cigars throughout this book!
