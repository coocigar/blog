    This is a backup site for <a target="_blank" href="http://coocigarblog.wordpress.com">
        My Cigar Blog on WordPress</a>.

    WordPress had suspended my website due to a false detection by their automated anti-spam controls. 
    The support was able to help me unflag it and get the website back up and running. However, I was 
    really stress that night because WordPress.com is a place where I try to document my cigar journey from the beginning of the time. 
</p>
<p>    
    Since I am a developer myself, I figured that I will just make a simplified version. 
    WordPress.com has more cool features that can help me organzie and display my content better. 
    However, to prevent my data being hold captive and have 
    the potential to get loss forever again, I figured that it only make sense if I make a backup 
    for myself.
